fizzbuzz

fizzbuzz.js is a simple module that takes in any one number and prints fizz or buzz or fizzbuzz based on "else if"s that divide the number by 3, 5, and 3&&5 respectively.

extendedFizzBuzz.js takes in an array of number and a corresponding array of words and prints the corresponding words for each number 1-106
The position of the number in the first array must correspond with the position of the word to print in the second if "i" is divisible by it
